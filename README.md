# Lalilo's Cyclope

![](logo.png)

Marjorie, one of Lalilo's designer has tasked you to animate part of its logo: the eye/o. Here's what she expects:
- She'd like to see the eye in a webpage
- The pupil should follow the movements of the cursor
- When the cursor hovers the moving part
  - Play the clic.mp3 file
  - Animate the pupil away from the cursor
  - Once the pupil has stopped animate the eyelashes laterally

She apologizes for the quality of the handoff, notably the lack of specs on animations. She had very little time before going on holidays for 2 weeks but trusts you to handle this nicely.

The dev team would like you to write some typescript code with react so that it integrates nicely with the current codebase.
